yahtzee_v1:



yahtzee_v2:
*Moved Yahtzee's script code from <body> to Yahtzee() in <head>
*Moved Yahtzee() to Yahtzee.js
*Created User.js with User() as its default constructor
*Converted all ScoreCard functions that don't have vector in it to JS.
*Fixed BUG: Yahtzee.prototype.startGame = function () by 
 creating a new Array() object in main().

yahtzee_v3
* Passed User object from Yahtzee.html to to Yahtzee.js startGame().
* ScoreCard.prototype.setFinalSC = function (scorecard) passed an object.
* getUpperScore(), getLowerScore(), getRound() return a value rather than a document.write().
* Converted ScoreCard.getTotalScore()
* Converted 95% of ScoreCard.js fillScoreCard()
* Converted 95% of Yahtzee.js startGame90 and play()
* Changed vector<int> selected to selected = [5] in ScoreCard.js

yahtzee_v4:
* Created 2 columns on ScoreCard.html: diceMsgCol & scorecardCol.
  * BUG! class="column: aren't floating left?
* Added Logan's code to write the scorecards category button when it is clicked.
* setScoreCard() rewrites value in the scorecard.
* printDice() rewrites each dice on ScoreCard.html
* Yahtzee.js writes the div for user to input number of players
* Tried converting cin>>name in getNPlayer() wtih document.getElementById("nPlayerSubmit").addEventListener("click", this.getNPlayer).
* BUG: in Yahtzee.js: document.getElementById("nPlayerSubmit").addEventListener("click", this.getNPlayer)
* fillScoreCard() rewrites values on ScoreCard.html
* Added bonus table row on ScoreCard.html.

* Converted: 
	* Yahtzee displayOptions() to printPlayMenu().
	* In printPlayMenu(), I replaced cin>>resp with event listener setChoice().
	* getNPlayer() to promptNPlayer(). nightmare!


yahtzee_html_v5:


yahtzee_html_v6.1:
* i figured how to aggregate ScoreCard class within Yahtzee
constructor and be able to access scorecard and finalFC throughout
Yahtzee.js.


yahtzee_html_v7.1_noPrompts:
I removed all the prompts and wrote the input divs to the page dynamically. 
The game is not stopping and getting the input from printMenu(), selectDice(), or
pickCategory(). If I put prompts in, the game will stop when it's supposed to, but
it won't display the dice or scorecard on the html.

Moved showPickCategory(), categoryClick(), and setFinalSC() to Yahtzee, so I could
reference scorecard's object when setting the finalScoreCard.scores.

v7.2_modals: 
Removed all loops and replaced them with if conditionals and 
it stopped the game from running through all 13 rounds. Added buttons to
control game play. added checkRounds() and checkNumRolls() to yahtzee.js.


To-do:

* ScoreCard.html.
        *BUG! the 2 colums class="column: aren't floating left?

* ScoreCard.js:
	* setFinalSC(): convert cin>>choice 
	* fillScoreCard() convert:
		* isYahtzee = all_of(counts.begin(), counts.end(), [&](int count) { return count == NUM_DICE; }); 
		* this.recordScore(7, three_of_a_kind ? accumulate(dice, dice + NUM_DICE, 0) : 0);
	* selectDice: not re-rolling dice. 
	* BUG: in Yahtzee.js: document.getElementById("nPlayerSubmit").addEventListener("click", this.getNPlayer)

* Yahtzee.js:
	
	
	* selectDice(): convert cin >> choice
	* convert getRules()
	* Make getP1Winner() work
	* change MAXRND to 13 and then replace finalSC.NUM_CATGRY with MAXRND.

* User.js convert: 
	* get User(i)->readNumRec() to work
	* reWrtBin()
